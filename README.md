# Keylogger Program

## Introduction
The Keylogger Program is made in C++. It remembers what you type on your keyboard, like when you press and let go of keys. I made this to show that I can design and make software using C++ and solve problems in programming.

*Important Note:* Only use this for good and fair reasons. It's not right to use it for bad things.

## Features
- It quietly remembers what you type without causing problems for you.
- It writes down the keys you press in special files so you can look at them later.
